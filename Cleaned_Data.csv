Over the years Australia has developed a conventional submarine force which is second to none in our region or the world.

The submarine's principal task is to keep Australia's maritime environment free from the threat of incursion by hostile ships and submarines. To achieve this aim the submarine may operate in conjunction with other ships as part of a task group or operate as an independent unit far from home or support. Submarines achieve their aim primarily by detecting the noise from an unknown contact. That noise source is then tracked, classified and if required, engaged with a variety of weapons. However the submarines primary weapon is stealth.

Major techniques employed for the detection of other submarines and ships include broad and narrow band detection. Broadband uses the combined noise that a contact may be putting into the water whereas narrowband analysis allows a submarine to fingerprint a contact based on specific machinery noises.

An Acoustic Analyst Submariner (known in the Navy as Acoustic Warfare Analyst Submariner) operates, supervises and manages all passive and active sonar's and acoustic sensors onboard a Collins Class submarine. An AWA SM is trained to detect, track and classify noise sources in the oceans. This information that the AWA SM provides Command is critical for the Submarine to achieve the aim.

Acoustic information which is passed to command can consist of classification of sonar contacts, tactical recommendations relating to that contact and also environmental data on how it can help us evade a threat or increase our tactical advantage over contacts.

AWA SM's come under the seamanship branch, so when the submarine is on the surface you do a variety of duties consisting of a control room watch-keeper, act as a lookout, Helmsman and standby Fire Party.
